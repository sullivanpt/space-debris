Hacking something up in [aframe](https://aframe.io)

# Development

Everything needed for the gsame is contained in the 'public' folder.  All dependencies are loaded via CDN references.  There is no server side code, and
no npm depedencies.  However, [live-server](http://tapiov.net/live-server/) is
recommended for convenient local development; it watches your local files and
automatically reloads the web browser on change.  To get started:

    $ npm install
    $ npm run start

## Bonus

I've been starting some additional, indpendent games in sibling top-level folders.
